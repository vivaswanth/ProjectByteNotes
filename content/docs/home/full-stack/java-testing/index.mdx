## 🎯 Testing Roadmap

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Unit Testing Foundations
    - JUnit 5: test lifecycle, annotations, assertions, parameterized tests.
    - TestNG: groups, parallel execution, data providers.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Mocking & Stubbing
    - Mockito: creating mocks, stubbing methods, verifying interactions.
    - Advanced Mockito: argument captors, spies, custom answers.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Framework Design Patterns
    - POM (Page Object Model) for UI
    - Data-driven testing → CSV/Excel, DataProvider, ParameterizedTest
    - Reusable utilities (logging, reporting, test data mgmt)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Behavior-Driven Testing
    - Cucumber BDD → Gherkin syntax, step definitions, runner setup
    - Spock (optional, Groovy-based but integrates with Java)
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### UI & End-to-End Testing
    - Selenium WebDriver basics → locators, actions, waits
    - Selenium Jupiter → JUnit 5 extension, Dockerized browsers
    - Selenide for simplified syntax
    - Integrating with CI/CD pipelines
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### API & Integration Testing
    - Spring Boot Test → @SpringBootTest, @WebMvcTest, @DataJpaTest
    - MockMvc for controller tests
    - TestContainers for real DB and infra testing
    - REST Assured for API testing
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Test Automation & CI/CD
    - Maven/Gradle test lifecycle integration
    - Running tests in CI (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
    - Generating reports (Allure, ExtentReports)
    - Code coverage tools (JaCoCo, Nexus IQ, SonarQube)
    - Dockerized Test Environments
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Advanced Testing Topics
    - Performance → Gatling / JMeter basics
    - Security testing basics with OWASP ZAP
    - Mutation Testing → LittleDarwin / PIT Mutation
    - Property-based testing with JUnit QuickCheck
    - Architectural testing with ArchUnit
    - Performance testing basics with JMH
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Summary of Popular Java Testing Frameworks

| Category | Framework | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Unit Testing** | **JUnit 5** | Core testing foundation. Default choice for all Java projects. |
| | **TestNG** | Alternative to JUnit; strong in parallel test execution. |
| **Mocking** | **Mockito** | Works standalone; often used with JUnit. Plays nicely in Spring Boot too. |
| | **EasyMock** | Older not widely used anymore but still independent. |
| | **JMockit** | Can mock static/final/private; works without Spring. |
| **Integration / System Testing** | **REST Assured** | Standalone API testing library. Spring Boot only makes setup easier. |
| | **TestContainers** | Independent; spins up Docker containers. Useful with or without Spring. |
| | **Spring Boot Test** | Tightly coupled to Spring 🌱. Provides annotations like `@SpringBootTest`, `@DataJpaTest`. |
| **BDD (Behavior-Driven Dev)** | **Cucumber (Gherkin)** | Works in plain Java projects and Spring Boot. Spring just helps with DI glue. |
| | **JBehave** | Older BDD option; independent. |
| **Architecture / Advanced Testing** | **JUnit QuickCheck** | Property-based testing; independent. |
| | **ArchUnit** | Tests architectural rules; independent of Spring. |
| **UI / E2E Testing** | **Selenium / Selenide** | Fully independent; Spring doesn’t matter here. |

## ✅ Best Practices
  - Write small, independent tests
  - Keep naming conventions clear (test methods should explain intent)
  - Use mocks/stubs only when necessary
  - Separate test logic from test data
  - Automate reporting & integrate with CI early
  - Practice TDD/BDD regularly
  - Continuously refactor test suites
