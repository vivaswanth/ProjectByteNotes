## Introduction
Testing / QA process is a critical aspect of software development that ensures code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

  <Accordion title="Testing Approaches">
    - `Pro-active Testing` → Write tests before or during dev to catch issues early.
      - Test Driven Development (TDD): at unit level (java methods).
      - Behavior Driven Development (BDD): at method (business workflow).
    - `Reactive Testing` → Writing tests after dev to verify functionality + catch bugs.
      - Exploratory Testing: Manual testing to explore app behavior.
      - Regression Testing: Re-running existing tests to ensure changes don’t break functionality.
      - Automated Testing: Using tools to run test automation (unit, integration, E2E).

    | -----------|-----------|----------|
    | Full code access | No code access | Partial code access |
    | Tests Internal Logic | Tests External Behavior| Tests Interactions |
    | Fast and Isolated | Slower and End-to-End | Moderate and API Focused |
    | Code correctness | Requirements fulfillment | Component interaction |
    | Unit Testing, Code Coverage | E2E Testing, Functional Testing | Integration Testing |
    | Eg: JUnit, Mockito | Eg: Selenium, Cucumber | Eg: Spring Boot Test |
