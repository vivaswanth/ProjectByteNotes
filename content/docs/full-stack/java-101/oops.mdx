## OOPS concepts
### Foundation for clean, maintainable, reusable architecture

- **Abstraction** - Hides internal complexities, exposing only vital interfaces. This makes systems easier to design and maintain.

Encapsulation: Packages data and methods; guards against unintended side effects.

Inheritance: Promotes code reuse by letting classes inherit traits.

Polymorphism: Allows one interface to represent different underlying types; enables flexible, extensible code.

Why they matter: They enable patterns like those in the Design Patterns: GoF book for creating robust, reusable designs.

# JDK -> JVM -> JRE
### Essential for effective setup, deployment, performance tuning

# Memory Allocation
### Manage resource use for responsive, robust systems

# Methods

# Data Structures

# Exception Handling

# Garbage Collection

# Collections Framework
### Handling and transforming data effectively and cleanly

# Multi-threading

# File Handling

# Java I/O

# Synchronization
### For scalable, safe task execution

# Regex

# Networking

# JDBC Connectivity
